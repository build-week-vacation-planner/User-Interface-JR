# User-Interface-JR

ive created a Landing page for the Vacation Planner app that my team has assembled. The landing page is designed to catch the 
eye of the reader and have them click the get started button to transfer them to the sign up/ log in side of the app which
would be the React side of the app.

I've also created an About page that lists what the app is all about, what problem it addresses, and how it helps. the About page
also lists out some members of the team and their roles.
